## Getting Started

To install run

```
pnpm install
```

And to start dev run

```
pnpm dev
```

Head to settings page. Fill in your OpenAI API Key and Postgres SQL database credentials. Then you can create an assitant there. Now head to DB Chat page to start chatting.

Disclaimer:
Your credentials are persisted locally. If you still have security concerns you can manually clear them after usage.

DB assitant won't execute SQL, but you can copy the SQL to console tab and execute them there. But I still suggest you use a dev database or a read-only user to prevent potential data loss because we cannot predict the SQL generated by AI. Once you get the SQL you want you can manually execute it on your production database.

## Features

- Create OpenAI Assistant with built-in custom instructions and dynamically fetched table names.
- Dynamically fetch table schemas with OpenAI functions
- Dynamically fetch entity relations with OpenAI functions
- Generate SQLs and run/debug them right in SQL console tab.

DB Assistant will call functions automatically to fetch your table schemas and relations to generate more accurate SQL based on your data than vanilla ChatGPT.
